We asked them their age and level of satisfaction with their job.\n\n\n\nWe store their responses in a data frame called survey_df. It has 10,000 observations (one for each respondent) and three variables: a unique id (id); their age in years (age); and their level of satisfaction (sat), which can take one of four values: very unsatisfied, unsatisfied, satisfied, and very satisfied.\n\nsurvey_df\n\n# A tibble: 10,000 × 3\n      id   age sat             \n   <int> <int> <chr>           \n 1     1    20 Unsatisfied     \n 2     2    27 Very unsatisfied\n 3     3    42 Very satisfied  \n 4     4    20 Very unsatisfied\n 5     5    37 Unsatisfied     \n 6     6    26 Satisfied       \n 7     7    60 Very satisfied  \n 8     8    63 Very unsatisfied\n 9     9    42 Satisfied       \n10    10    40 Very unsatisfied\n# ℹ 9,990 more rows\n\n\n\nFrequency distribution\nWe can take advantage of janitor::tabyl() to quickly calculate the number and proportion of respondents who provided each level of satisfaction.\n\ntabyl(survey_df, sat)\n\n              sat    n percent\n        Satisfied 2579  0.2579\n      Unsatisfied 2414  0.2414\n   Very satisfied 2508  0.2508\n Very unsatisfied 2499  0.2499\n\n\nAlternatively, we can use skimr::skim() to get a useful summary of this categorical variable.\n\nskim(survey_df$sat)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nsurvey_df$sat\n\n\nNumber of rows\n10000\n\n\nNumber of columns\n1\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n1\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\ndata\n0\n1\n9\n16\n0\n4\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing this frequency\nWe can easily visualize this using a bar chart.\n\np1 <- survey_df |> \n  tabyl(sat) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = sat)) + \n  geom_col() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\np2 <- survey_df |> \n  tabyl(sat) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = percent, y = sat)) + \n  geom_col() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\np1 | p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with factors\nNotice how our categories are ordered: very satisfied sits above satisfied. We can tell R this information factor().\n\nsurvey_df <- survey_df |> \n  mutate(\n    sat = factor(sat, levels = c(\"Very unsatisfied\", \n                                 \"Unsatisfied\", \n                                 \"Satisfied\", \n                                 \"Very satisfied\"))\n  )\n\nNow when we work with our categorical variables, they will be ordered.\n\nsurvey_df |> \n  tabyl(sat) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = sat)) + \n  geom_col() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribing continuous variables\nWe can also get a good sense of our continuous variable age by looking at the center, spread, and shape of its distribution.\n\nFive number summary\nWe can use skimr::skim() to quickly get useful information on our continuous variable.\n\nskim(survey_df$age)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nsurvey_df$age\n\n\nNumber of rows\n10000\n\n\nNumber of columns\n1\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nnumeric\n1\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\ndata\n0\n1\n39.96\n14.79\n15\n27\n40\n53\n65\n▇▇▇▇▇\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\n\nggplot(survey_df, aes(x = age)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(survey_df, aes(x = age)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity curves\n\nggplot(survey_df, aes(x = age)) + \n  geom_density() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBox and whisker plots\n\nggplot(survey_df, aes(x = age)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for patterns in our groups\n\nggplot(survey_df, aes(x = age, y = sat)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(survey_df, aes(x = age, y = sat)) + \n  geom_violin() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding distributions\n\nNormal distribution\n\ntibble(z = rnorm(n = 1000)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = z)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\ntibble(z = rnorm(n = 1e6)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = z)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight skewed distribution\n\ntibble(z = rbeta(10000, 2, 10)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = z)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft skewed distribution\n\ntibble(z = rbeta(10000, 10, 2)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = z)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode\n\nMean\nThe mean is the average of all values.\n\n\nMedian\nThe median is the mid-point of all values.\n\n\nMode\nThe mode is the most frequent of all values.\n\n\nUsing central tendency to describe and understand distributions\nNormally distributed vectors share their mean and medians.\n\nnorm_dist <- tibble(z = rnorm(n = 1000))\n\nggplot(norm_dist, aes(x = z)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(norm_dist$z), colour = \"red\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = median(norm_dist$z), colour = \"blue\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFor right skewed data, the mean is greater than the median.\n\nright_dist <- tibble(z = rbeta(10000, 2, 10))\n\nggplot(right_dist, aes(x = z)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(right_dist$z), colour = \"red\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = median(right_dist$z), colour = \"blue\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFor left skewed data, the mean is smaller than the median.\n\nleft_dist <- tibble(z = rbeta(10000, 10, 2))\n\nggplot(left_dist, aes(x = z)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(left_dist$z), colour = \"red\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = median(left_dist$z), colour = \"blue\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasures of spread: range, variance, and standard deviation\n\nRange\nThe range is the difference between the largest and smallest value.\n\nmax(survey_df$age) - min(survey_df$age)\n\n[1] 50\n\n\n\n\nVariance\nThe variance measures how spread out your values are. Take a look at these two plots. Both have the same center point (0) and number of observations (1,000,000). However, the data are much more spread out around that center point in the top graph.\n\nwide_dist <- tibble(z = rnorm(1e6, sd = 2))\n\np1 <- ggplot(wide_dist, aes(x = z)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-4, 4))\n\nnarrow_dist <- tibble(z = rnorm(1e6, sd = 1))\n\np2 <- ggplot(narrow_dist, aes(x = z)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-4, 4))\n\np1 / p2\n\n\n\n\nThe data in the top graph have far more variance than those in the bottom graph. We measure this by calculating the average of the squares of the deviations of the observations from their mean.\n\\[\ns^2 = \\frac{\\Sigma(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n - 1}\n\\]\nLet’s step through this. We will first calculate the variance for wide_dist, or the top graph.\n\nwide_var_calc <- wide_dist |> \n  mutate(\n    mean = mean(wide_dist$z),\n    diff = z - mean,\n    diff_2 = diff^2\n  )\n\nwide_var_calc\n\n# A tibble: 1,000,000 × 4\n         z    mean    diff  diff_2\n     <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 -0.921  0.00268 -0.924  0.853  \n 2  1.63   0.00268  1.63   2.65   \n 3 -0.0416 0.00268 -0.0443 0.00196\n 4  0.779  0.00268  0.777  0.603  \n 5  0.494  0.00268  0.492  0.242  \n 6 -0.738  0.00268 -0.740  0.548  \n 7 -0.130  0.00268 -0.133  0.0176 \n 8 -1.58   0.00268 -1.58   2.51   \n 9  1.82   0.00268  1.82   3.30   \n10 -0.127  0.00268 -0.129  0.0167 \n# ℹ 999,990 more rows\n\n\nWe take the sum of square of the difference between each observation and the mean of our whole sample. We then divide that by one less than our number of observations.\n\nwide_var <- sum(wide_var_calc$diff_2) / (nrow(wide_var_calc) - 1)\n\nwide_var\n\n[1] 4.00025\n\n\nWe can compare this to the variance for our narrower distribution.\n\nnarrow_var_calc <- narrow_dist |> \n  mutate(\n    mean = mean(narrow_dist$z),\n    diff = z - mean,\n    diff_2 = diff^2\n  )\n\nnarrow_var <- sum(narrow_var_calc$diff_2) / (nrow(narrow_var_calc) - 1)\n\nnarrow_var\n\n[1] 1.000964\n\n\nIt is, in fact, smaller!\nWe can use var() to do this in one step:\n\nvar(wide_dist)\n\n        z\nz 4.00025\n\n\n\nvar(narrow_dist)\n\n         z\nz 1.000964\n\n\n\n\nStandard deviation\nA simpler measure of spread is the standard deviation. It is simply the square root of the variance.\n\nsqrt(wide_var)\n\n[1] 2.000063\n\n\n\nsqrt(narrow_var)\n\n[1] 1.000482\n\n\nIf you look back to our graphs, you will see that I set the standard deviations explicitly when I generated the data. rnorm() takes an sd argument. This is great because we can confirm that the standard deviations for the wide and narrow distributions are 2 and 1 respectively (with a little bit of noise).\n\ntibble(\n  n = rnorm(1e6, sd = 1),\n  w = rnorm(1e6, sd = 2)\n) |> \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_density(aes(x = n), colour = \"green\") + \n  geom_density(aes(x = w), colour = \"lightblue\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardization\nNotice how our description of each variable depends on its units of measurement. What do we do if we want to compare across different measurements that have different units?\n\nZ scores\nFor normal distributions, we can use the z score. This gives us a standard way of understanding how many standard deviations from the mean of a normally distributed variable a value is.\n\\[\nz_i = \\frac{x_i - \\mu_x}{\\sigma_x}\n\\]"
